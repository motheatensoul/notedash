# Important Instructions for Agents

The following instructions should never be deleted or moved under any circumstances and must obeyed at all times.

- keep usage of external dependencies to the absolute minimum while using industry standard solutions for solved problems (i.e. file parsing, auth, visuals, etc.)
- never trust that information from your training data is 100% accurate, always use search to reconfirm if APIs etc. have changed.
- be open and honest about uncertainty, always communicate when you are unsure about something or need further input
- write complete and professional doccomments for all code you produce, according to the best practises for whatever language is being used
- document architecture, usage and dev-relevant information in ./docs as .md files
- always write professional commits for all changes you complete
- write clear, concise and minimal code. Do not write scaff1olding for code you aren't actively working on, that will bloat the code base
- ALWAYS WRITE GIT COMMITS FOR ALL CHANGES YOU MAKE WITHOUT BEING TOLD TO! PREFIX THEM WITH "fix", "feat", etc. IN THE MESSAGE!

## Session bootstrap notes (keep updated)

### Project layout

- `apps/web`: SvelteKit 5 frontend (browser + desktop-hosted UI), Tailwind v4 + shadcn-svelte components.
- `apps/desktop`: Tauri v2 shell that runs the web app.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri`: Rust desktop entrypoint and Tauri config.
- `crates/core`: shared Rust logic compiled to WASM for web use.
- `packages/types`: shared TypeScript types.
- `docs`: architecture, configuration, integration, security, and development notes.

### Key paths to check first in new sessions

- `apps/web/src/routes/+page.svelte`: dashboard composition, widget wiring, onboarding open state, refresh loops.
- `apps/web/src/lib/components/`: app-level components (`OnboardingModal`, `SetupChecklist`, `FeedStatusSettings`, `WidgetCard`, `StatusPill`, `SectionHeading`).
- `apps/web/src/lib/components/ui/`: generated shadcn-svelte primitives.
- `apps/web/src/app.css`: shadcn/tailwind tokens + app-level aliases and base styles.
- `apps/web/src/routes/+layout.svelte`: imports global stylesheet.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: CI dependency/runtime setup.

### Build, check, and dev commands

- Root verify: `bun run verify`
- Web only: `bun run --cwd apps/web check` and `bun run --cwd apps/web test`
- WASM build: `bun run build:wasm` or `just wasm`
- Desktop dev: `bun run dev` (root), which calls `apps/desktop` Tauri dev.
- Browser dev: `bun run dev:browser`
- Web cache clear (for stale Vite/SvelteKit state): `bun run --cwd apps/web clean:cache`

### CI and platform notes

- Linux CI requires system packages for Tauri/Rust GTK bindings (`pkg-config`, `libglib2.0-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libsoup-3.0-dev`, appindicator/rsvg, and webkit2gtk dev package).
- Workflow currently installs `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` when available, otherwise falls back to `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`.

### UI/theming conventions

- Prefer shadcn-svelte primitives in `apps/web/src/lib/components/ui/` over bespoke controls.
- Prefer Lucide icons via `@lucide/svelte`.
- Keep status visuals centralized through shared components (currently `StatusPill.svelte`).
- Reuse shared section title pattern via `SectionHeading.svelte`.

### Open follow-ups (rolling)

- Re-run GitHub Actions CI after workflow dependency updates to confirm glib/webkit package errors are resolved.
- Keep `docs/development.md` and related docs synced whenever workflow/tooling/theming conventions change.

### Recent changes log (session handoff)

Use this section as a lightweight handoff trail. Keep entries short, factual, and newest-first.

Template:

- `YYYY-MM-DD`: `<scope>` — <what changed>.
  - Files: `<path1>`, `<path2>`
  - Verify: `<command>`
